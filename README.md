## About Me

Hello! I'm **Spencer Wood**, a data scientist and ML engineer with a Master's in Business Analytics & Data Science. My work focuses on:

- **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
- **Computer Vision & Image Processing**
- **Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Finance**
- **MLOps & Production ML Systems**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Cybersecurity & Information Security** (currently learning)

I work on building ML/DL models, developing solutions in big data environments, and taking projects from concept to production. My GitHub showcases my learning journey and the projects I've worked on, from research prototypes to production systems. I'm interested in both the research and development side of machine learning as well as deploying models at scale.

I'm currently expanding into cybersecurity, studying for the CompTIA Security+ certification and learning through Hack the Box Academy. I'm also exploring how to apply data science techniques to cybersecurity challenges, combining my analytical background with security knowledge.

### What I Do
- Build and develop ML/DL models from research to implementation
- Work with big data technologies and distributed computing environments
- Deploy models to production with MLOps practices
- Develop end-to-end data workflows and pipelines
- Create data visualizations and interactive dashboards

### Currently Working On
- **CompTIA Security+ Certification** - Studying to pass the Security+ exam and build foundational cybersecurity knowledge
- **Hack the Box Academy** - Actively working through courses, modules, and learning paths to develop cybersecurity skills
- **Cybersecurity-Focused Data Science Projects** - Applying data science techniques to cybersecurity problems (in progress)
- Finalizing and bringing previous projects to production level
- Cleaning up, refactoring, and documenting existing work
