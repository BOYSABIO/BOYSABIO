## About Me

Hello! I'm **Spencer Wood**, a data scientist and ML engineer with a completed Master's in Business Analytics & Data Science. My background spans:

- **Deep Learning & Neural Networks**
- **Computer Vision & Image Processing**
- **Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Finance**
- **MLOps & Production ML Systems**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

Currently, my focus is on finalizing and productionizing all the projects I’ve started—bringing them to a full production level. I’m mastering the process of taking both machine learning and deep learning models from research to modular, scalable, production-ready pipelines. My GitHub is a representation of this journey and the breadth of work I’ve completed.

### What I Do
- Productionize and deploy ML/DL models in modular, scalable pipelines
- Refactor and document codebases for maintainability and collaboration
- Build end-to-end data workflows, from data ingestion to deployment
- Design and implement MLOps best practices for robust, reproducible systems
- Create interactive dashboards and data visualizations

### Currently Working On
- Finalizing and bringing previous projects to production level
- Cleaning up, refactoring, and documenting existing work
- Focusing on new personal projects (some not yet public)
