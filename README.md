## About

I’ve been taking things apart since I was a kid. I fried the motherboard of my first PC at 10, rebuilt it out of necessity, and that cycle of breaking → understanding → rebuilding never really stopped.

Academically and professionally I’ve always been on the **AI / ML / deep learning / data science** path—research projects, capstones, and production‑style ML systems. In parallel, **security has been a long‑standing obsession**: networks, systems, and how things fail in the real world. Now I’m deliberately merging the two: using data and ML to understand infrastructure, monitor networks, and reason about risk.

I’ve spent roughly half my life in the US and half across Europe, which forced me to adapt to new environments and think in systems. Today I work where **AI, data, markets, and security collide**—building end‑to‑end ML and data systems, instrumenting infrastructure, and looking for “beneficial accidents” that reveal new signals or mechanics to exploit.

I care about solutions that **scale**, that solve real problems I run into, and that push me toward technical mastery. I’ll usually take the harder path first; understanding the long route makes the shortcuts obvious.

<b>What I work on</b>

- Applied ML & MLOps – turning research notebooks into maintainable, production‑style systems  
- Data & infrastructure – pipelines, observability, streaming / real‑time processing  
- Security‑adjacent analytics – network visibility, traffic analysis, security telemetry  
- Quant & markets work – market microstructure, simulation, risk / volatility modeling  

    </td>
    <td valign="top" width="50%">

<b>Current focus</b>

- Operating and evolving a personal **network monitoring & observability lab**  
- Studying for **CompTIA Security+** and turning long‑time security interest into a formal specialty  
- Applying ML and data science to infrastructure / security‑adjacent data (network traffic, logs, telemetry)  
- Refactoring older academic projects into production‑quality systems
